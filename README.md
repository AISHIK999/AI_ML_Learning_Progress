# AI/ML Learning Progress

* This repository contains all the codes that I created while learning the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from scratch.
* Some of these codes are very basic, since I am still scratching the surface of the subject.
* The codes are written in Python, and every operation has been explained inside the codes through comments.
